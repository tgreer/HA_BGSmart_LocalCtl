Local control integration for BG Smart (Luceco) dimmer switches and smart sockets using the ESP Local Control protocol.

## Features

✅ **100% Local Control** - No cloud dependency, works without internet  
✅ **Fast Response** - 50-100ms latency vs 500ms-2s for cloud  
✅ **Privacy Friendly** - All communication stays on your local network  
✅ **Full Brightness Control** - On/Off and 0-100% dimming  
✅ **Smart Socket Support** - Per-outlet power and parental lock on double sockets  
✅ **Auto Configuration** - Reads device name and capabilities once you supply the IP  
⚠️ **No Network Auto-Discovery** - Devices must be added by IP address (see [Auto-Discovery](#auto-discovery) below)  
✅ **Secure** - Uses Sec1 encryption with PoP (Proof of Possession)  

## Supported Devices

- BG Smart Dimmer Switch (DMHCM)
- BG Smart Double Socket (Left/Right outlets with parental lock)
- Luceco Dimmer Controller
- Any ESP32-based BG Smart/Luceco device with local control

### Entities Created

| Device | Entities |
|--------|----------|
| Dimmer | One `light` entity with brightness |
| Double Socket | One device with `switch.<name>_left_socket`, `switch.<name>_right_socket`, and a `... parental lock` switch for each outlet |

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2024.1.0 or newer
- BG Smart dimmer or smart socket on the same local network
- PoP (Proof of Possession) key from device label

## Installation

### Method 1: HACS (Recommended)

1. **Add Custom Repository**
   - Open HACS in Home Assistant
   - Click the 3 dots in top right → **Custom repositories**
   - Add repository URL: `https://github.com/rrwood/HA_BGSmart_LocalCtl`
   - Category: **Integration**
   - Click **Add**

2. **Install Integration**
   - Search for "BG Smart Local Control" in HACS
   - Click **Download**
   - Restart Home Assistant

3. **Add Integration**
   - Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
   - Click **Add Integration**
   - Search for "BG Smart Local Control"
   - Follow configuration steps below

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. **Download Files**
   ```bash
   cd /config
   git clone https://github.com/rrwood/HA_BGSmart_LocalCtl.git
   cp -r HA_BGSmart_LocalCtl/custom_components/bg_smart_local custom_components/
   ```

2. **Restart Home Assistant**

3. **Add Integration** (see configuration below)

## Configuration

### Step 1: Find Your Device Information

Before configuring, you need:

1. **Device IP Address**
   - Check your router's DHCP client list
   - Or use a network scanner app
   - Recommended: Set a static IP or DHCP reservation

2. **PoP (Proof of Possession) Key**
   - Printed on the device label
   - **Also shown as "Device ID" in BG Smart app** → Device Settings screen
   - Usually a string of characters/numbers (8-16 characters)

### Step 2: Add Integration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for "BG Smart Local Control"
4. Enter configuration:
   - **Device IP Address**: Your dimmer's IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
   - **Port**: `8080` (default, pre-filled)
   - **PoP Key**: From device label (required)
   - **Node ID**: Leave empty (optional, not currently used)

5. Click **Submit**

### Step 3: Verify

The integration will:
- ✅ Connect to your device
- ✅ Read the device name (e.g., "Lounge" or "Utility Room Smart Socket")
- ✅ Create a light entity for dimmers (e.g., `light.lounge`) or switch entities for sockets
- ✅ Show current on/off state (and brightness for dimmers)

## Usage

### Basic Control

#### Dimmers

The dimmer appears as a standard Home Assistant light entity:

```yaml
# Turn on at 50% brightness
service: light.turn_on
target:
  entity_id: light.lounge
data:
  brightness_pct: 50

# Turn off
service: light.turn_off
target:
  entity_id: light.lounge
```

#### Smart Sockets

A double socket appears as one device with a power switch and a parental lock switch per outlet (called "Parental Lock" in the BG Smart app):

```yaml
# Turn on the left outlet
service: switch.turn_on
target:
  entity_id: switch.utility_room_smart_socket_left_socket

# Enable parental lock on the right outlet
service: switch.turn_on
target:
  entity_id: switch.utility_room_smart_socket_right_socket_parental_lock
```

### Automations

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Dim lights at sunset"
    trigger:
      - platform: sun
        event: sunset
    action:
      - service: light.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: light.lounge
        data:
          brightness_pct: 30

  - alias: "Lights off at bedtime"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "23:00:00"
    action:
      - service: light.turn_off
        target:
          entity_id: light.lounge
```

### Scenes

```yaml
scene:
  - name: Movie Time
    entities:
      light.lounge:
        state: on
        brightness_pct: 20
```

### Dashboard Card

```yaml
type: light
entity: light.lounge
name: Lounge Dimmer
```

## Auto-Discovery

This integration does **not** currently discover devices on the network. Every dimmer or socket must be added manually with its IP address (a static IP or DHCP reservation is strongly recommended).

- **Dimmers**: Auto-discovery is not implemented. Once you enter the IP, the device name and capabilities are read automatically.
- **Double sockets**: Auto-discovery is not implemented and has **not been tested**. In a local mDNS scan the socket did not advertise the standard `_esp_local_ctrl._tcp` service that Espressif's ESP Local Control normally publishes, so zeroconf-based discovery may not be possible without further investigation of the firmware.

If you find that your device does advertise itself on the network, please open an issue with the output of a scan (e.g. `dns-sd -B _services._dns-sd._udp` on macOS or `avahi-browse -a` on Linux) so discovery can be looked at.

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Connect to Device

**Check IP Address:**
```bash
ping 192.168.1.100  # Replace with your device IP
```

**Verify Port:**
- Default port is `8080`
- Device must be on same network as Home Assistant

**Check PoP Key:**
- Must match exactly from device label
- Case-sensitive
- No spaces

### Device Found But No Control

**Check Logs:**
```
Settings → System → Logs → Filter "bg_smart"
```

**Common Issues:**
- Wrong PoP key → Re-configure integration
- Network firewall blocking port 8080
- Device firmware outdated

### Brightness Not Working

**Delete and Re-add:**
1. Remove integration
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Re-add integration

### Enable Debug Logging

Add to `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.bg_smart_local: debug
```

Restart and check logs.

## FAQ

**Q: Where do I find the PoP key?**  
A: It's printed on a label on the device, usually on the back or inside. It may be labeled as "PoP", "Proof of Possession", or "Security Key".

**Q: Can I control multiple dimmers?**  
A: Yes! Add each dimmer as a separate integration with its own IP address.

**Q: Does this work with BG Smart sockets or other devices?**  
A: Dimmers and double sockets are supported (power and parental lock per outlet). Socket timers, schedules, and scenes are not yet exposed. Other device types may work but are untested.

**Q: What if I don't have the PoP key?**  
A: Check the BG Smart mobile app settings - it may display the PoP key. Otherwise, you'll need to contact BG Smart support.

**Q: Does this interfere with the BG Smart app?**  
A: No, both can be used simultaneously. Changes made in either app or Home Assistant will be reflected in both.

**Q: Can I use this without the BG Smart cloud?**  
A: Yes! This integration works completely independently of BG Smart cloud services.
